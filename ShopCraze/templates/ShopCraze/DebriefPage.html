    <p>Add specific Experiment instructions here, this will only be shown before round 1!</p-->
    <p>
        Dear Participant, <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your participation in our research study on online shopping behaviour. We appreciate your time and cooperation throughout the experiment. <br>
        <br>
        Now that the experiment has concluded, we would like to provide you with some additional information regarding the true aim of the study. While the initial purpose outlined in the explanatory statement focused on investigating consumers' shopping behavior and efficiency on E-commerce platforms across various product categories,
        the <strong>actual aim of the experiment was to study the effects and effectiveness of Digital Nudges used on e-commerce websites across different age groups and genders.</strong><br>
        <br>
        It was important for us to present the study in a way that did not influence your choices during the experiment. Had we explicitly mentioned the use of Digital Nudges, it could have affected your decision-making processes and altered the authenticity of your shopping behavior. Therefore, the original aim was intentionally modified to ensure unbiased participation and to prevent participants from being influenced by the knowledge of the nudges.
